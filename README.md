# üçî College Canteen Digitization App

## Project Overview

The College Canteen Digitization App is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to streamline and modernize the food ordering process for students at Narsee Monjee College of Commerce and Economics, Mumbai. It offers a seamless experience for students to browse the canteen menu, place orders, and make payments online, significantly reducing wait times.

Crucially, this system also includes a **robust order management platform** for canteen staff. It leverages **QR codes for efficient order confirmation** upon collection, and facilitates **user bill tracking and collection**, ensuring a smooth and accountable transaction process for both students and staff.

Developed with Python and the Flask web framework, this application provides an end-to-end digital solution for college canteen operations.

## Features

* **User Authentication:** Secure student login and registration system.
* **Dynamic Menu Display:** Browse current canteen offerings with item details and pricing.
* **Digital Order Placement:** Add multiple items to a cart, adjust quantities, and place orders digitally.
* **Online Payment Integration:** Seamless payment processing via **Razorpay's Python SDK**.
* **Order Tracking for Students:** Students can view their order status (e.g., pending, preparing, ready for collection).
* **Integrated Order Management Platform:** Dedicated interface for canteen staff to:
    * View and process incoming orders in real-time.
    * Update order statuses (e.g., "preparing," "ready for collection").
    * Track individual user bills.
* **QR Code Order Confirmation:** Unique QR codes generated for each order, enabling quick and secure confirmation upon collection by canteen staff.
* **User Bill Tracking & Collection:** Streamlined system for managing and confirming payment/collection of student bills.
* **Order History:** Students can review their past orders.
* **Responsive Design:** Accessible across various devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
